Changelog
=========

1.1.0

* Add an HttpApiMockResponse class for mocking the entire HTTP response (not just status and a JSON body).

1.0.5
=====

Bugfixes
--------

* HTTP status lines generated by HttpApiMock now include a full reason ('200 OK' instead of just '200').

1.0.4
=====

Bugfixes
--------

* HttpApiMock now completely supports behavior of http.client.HTTPResponse. This means it now works for any HTTP module (including requests).
